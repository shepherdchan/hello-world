GIS is a passion of mine. During undergrad, I took an intro GIS course, and absolutely fell in love with it. After college, I worked as a GIS Analyst for transportation projects. To help further develop my skills, I applied for the MSGIST program at the University of Arizona in which I am currently enrolled in.
